This is a demo app to do a POC using Typescript, React, Redux, and Immer.js in a shopping cart MVP.

To get started, after cloning the repository, make sure you install the dependencies before trying to run.

This can be done via `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Then, to run the shopping cart app locally, run:

```npm start```

or

```yarn start```


This is not a production ready app, so read/use at your own risk.
